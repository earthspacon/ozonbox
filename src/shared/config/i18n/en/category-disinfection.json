      "content": "The office is the face of the company. Polluted air with unpleasant odors harms staff, reduces productivity and loyalty, and damages the company's image with clients and partners.\n\nIn most buildings, concentrations of toxic substances in the air are 2–5 times higher than outdoors. Benzene, formaldehyde and ammonia are released from furniture, carpets, office equipment and finishes. Ozonation effectively neutralizes these pollutants.\n\nOzone disinfects everything staff and visitors touch: desktops, armrests, office equipment, coffee machines. It reduces virus transmission via surfaces, removes odors and freshens the air.\n\nTreatment is run at night on a timer. 1–2 hours of ozonation is usually enough. Ozone generator capacity: about 1 g/h per 25 m³ of room volume. By the time staff arrive, ozone has dissipated, leaving a light fresh smell.",

Ozonation allows quick and effective disinfection of bus, tram and trolleybus interiors between runs or at night.\n\nOzone disinfects everything passengers touch: handrails, seats, windows and walls. The gas penetrates all crevices and hard-to-reach areas for full interior treatment. Odors and mold growth are also suppressed.\n\nTreatment: 20–40 minutes depending on interior volume. After treatment, ventilate for 20 minutes or use the vehicle's ventilation system to clear ozone.\n\nEquipment can run from the vehicle's power (12V or 24V). No staff need to stay — turn on the generator and leave. No consumables reduce operating costs.",

Ozonation addresses both: it disinfects equipment and removes sweat odor.\n\nOzone destroys bacteria, viruses, mold, fungi and parasitic protozoa on equipment, stands, benches and mats. The gas penetrates material pores for deep disinfection.\n\nSports facilities are treated at night. 2–3 hours at about 1 g/h per 25 m³ is typical. For large halls and arenas, mobile ozone generators of 60–120 g/h are used.\n\nAfter the generator is off, ozone drops to safe levels in 2–3 hours. Only a light fresh smell remains. Staff should not enter during treatment.",
