Ozonation is an effective removal method, especially when metals are present as organic complexes.\n\nStandard iron removal methods (aeration, lime, cation exchange) are ineffective with organic compounds. Ozone oxidizes complexes, causing iron and manganese to precipitate for subsequent filtration.\n\nRequired ozone dose: about 1 mg per 1 mg iron and 4 mg per 1 mg manganese. Oxidation is effective at any pH of natural waters. Ozone converts Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺, which forms solid Fe(OH)₃ precipitate, easily removed by filtration.\n\nThe technology includes ozonation in a contact tank followed by mechanical and carbon filtration. For high manganese, double ozonation is used for complete metal precipitation.",
