      "content": "Uncontrolled mold growth in warehouse facilities leads to product spoilage and poor employee health. Mold spores and toxins in the air undermine staff immunity, while spoilage of goods and cardboard increases waste.\n\nWarehouse ozonation addresses the problem comprehensively: it destroys existing contamination hotspots, suppresses new mold and fungus colonies, eliminates unpleasant odors from microbial activity.\n\nOzone interacts with the membrane structure of bacterial and fungal cells, disrupting their barrier function and causing cell death. Unlike chemical agents, the gas penetrates all crevices and remote corners, treating hard-to-reach areas.\n\nFor effective mold control, ozonation is recommended for 1–3 hours during off-hours. Ozone generator capacity is selected at approximately 1 g/h per 25 m³ of room volume.",
