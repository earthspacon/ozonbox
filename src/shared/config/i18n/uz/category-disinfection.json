      "content": "Shopping malls are high-traffic spaces with dense visitor flow. Ozonation maintains air quality, removes odors and helps prevent infection spread.\n\nRegular ozone treatment during off-hours disinfects all surfaces: escalators, handrails, elevators, benches, restrooms. The gas reaches all areas, including back-of-house and technical zones.\n\nOzone effectively removes odors from food courts, restrooms and storage areas. It neutralizes chemical pollutants from finishes and merchandise. The air becomes fresh and pleasant for visitors.\n\nLarge malls use high-capacity industrial ozone generators or systems integrated with ventilation. Treatment is automated with timers and sensors.",
