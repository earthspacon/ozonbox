      "content": "Ozonation is the most effective method for removing ingrained odors in premises. Unlike air fresheners and deodorizers, ozone does not mask odors but fully breaks down odor molecules into safe compounds: water and carbon dioxide.\n\nAs a gas, ozone penetrates everywhere: crevices, material pores, upholstery, carpets and even ventilation systems. This allows treating all surfaces at once, including areas inaccessible to manual cleaning.\n\nOzonation effectiveness depends on odor intensity, room volume, temperature and humidity. Lower temperature means more stable ozone and longer activity. At 0–5°C ozone can remain active for days; at 50°C it decays in 20–30 minutes.\n\nAfter treatment, ozone fully decays to oxygen with no chemical residues. The room is ready for use after 30–60 minutes of ventilation.",

      "content": "Car interior ozonation is a popular service at car washes and detailing centers. Over time, odors build up: tobacco, spilled drinks, food, sweat, pets. They soak into seat upholstery, carpets, headliner and AC ducts.\n\nOzone penetrates all interior materials, including ventilation and AC. This matters especially because bacteria and fungi often accumulate in ducts and cause odor when the AC is on.\n\nStandard car ozonation takes 30–60 minutes. The ozone generator is placed inside, recirculation is turned on to treat the ventilation system. Ozone concentration: 20–40 mg/m³. Ventilate for 15–30 minutes after treatment.\n\nFor used cars, ozonation helps remove the \"previous owner smell.\" For dealerships and car-sharing, regular ozonation keeps fleets fresh and hygienic.",

      "content": "Carpets and upholstery are the main odor reservoirs in a room. Textile fibers absorb dust, fungal spores, bacteria, skin particles, sweat and spills. Over time a characteristic musty odor forms that normal cleaning cannot remove.\n\nOzonation complements conventional dry cleaning with deep deodorization and disinfection. After wet carpet cleaning, ozone penetrates fibers and destroys remaining bacteria, fungal spores and odor molecules.\n\nFor local treatment of furniture or carpet, \"chamber ozonation\" is used: the item is covered with plastic film and ozone is fed underneath. Exposure: 2–4 hours. This creates high ozone concentration directly in the item.\n\nOzonation is effective after flooding: it removes damp odor and prevents mold in wet furniture and carpets. Treatment should be done after items are dried.",
