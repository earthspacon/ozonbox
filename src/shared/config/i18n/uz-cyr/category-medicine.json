      "content": "Hospital ozonation provides the highest level of sterility, critical for preventing nosocomial infections. Ozone destroys bacteria, viruses, spores and fungi with up to 99.99% efficiency.\n\nOperating blocks require special sanitary regimes. Ozonation after surgery ensures deep disinfection of all surfaces, including hard-to-reach areas: equipment crevices, ventilation systems, ceiling fixtures.\n\nICU and resuscitation wards are high-risk zones for infection transmission between patients. Regular ozonation reduces microbial load in the air and on surfaces, complementing standard cleaning protocols.\n\nOzone is effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including MRSA and VRE, which pose a serious threat in healthcare. After treatment, ozone decays to oxygen with no toxic residues, which is important for patient safety.",

The process runs at 25–35°C and 80–90% relative humidity, which is safe for most materials.\n\nEndoscopic equipment is especially demanding. Complex construction with narrow channels creates a risk of incomplete treatment by traditional methods. Ozone gas penetrates all cavities and channels for full sterilization.\n\nThe ozone sterilization cycle includes: pre-humidification, exposure in ozone atmosphere for 30–60 minutes, and degassing. The method is validated for use in healthcare and meets sterilization standards.",
